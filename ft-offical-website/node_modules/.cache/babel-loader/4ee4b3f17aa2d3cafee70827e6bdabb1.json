Starting September 1st, users in Flushing, Long Island, Brooklyn and other key areas of New York can order the above services through the Fantuan app, and the platform will assign the order to be delivered by a courier in the system (excluding self-pickup orders). Meals are delivered within an hour and users can rank and review their entire delivery experience on Fantuan’s platform. 10 days after its New York launch, these services became available in the Irvine, California area.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fsH8vLvhYgbBSiiHnOsZ7_xA_lUsmPPmAzwaEnGNqlhLB0685tfsSt5IulSthxd8zRzjbp65nCE8f8E33kdlR1WONk2ZQSB7Bl0_9JXHs4HX1lfYLinZ2UmO7_oz-KIUQ-dVXToC\" height=\"auto\" width=\"859\"></span></p><p><span>Fantuan’s entry into the US is the most important step for its expansion over North America.

More importantly, whereas many US food delivery platforms can only offer their users to rate their experience (ex: out of 5), Fantuan users can leave ratings and actual reviews of their experience for other consumers to reference and for merchants to improve their service quality. Although Fantuan’s services are only offered in Mandarin in most of the company’s locations, it has begun developing and offering an English version of its app in Vancouver this past October, planning to offer services in English in all its other locations in the future.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/teE3BLUWTrKgwDPwfqch7aRlgXeQHoaJqnJRSDN1Cbh98TS3xwvFCzVkIT5jw8xnckx_sKEJOZnkAqMxeSKNr7nsp7gAnXU0vUzO2oz01lRpFHeOmTK21dFHtMec9E7KodB8Infv\" height=\"auto\" width=\"859\"></span></p>',\n  'user': 'Crystal Li'\n}];\nexport default NewsData;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/chengpeng/workspace/Ft-Official-Website/ft-offical-website/src/modules/home/fake_data/news_data.js"],"names":["NewsData"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAMA,QAAQ,GAAG,CACb;AACI,QAAM,CADV;AAEI,UAAQ,eAFZ;AAGI,WAAS,4KAHb;AAII,WAAS,+BAJb;AAKI,aAAW,g8DALf;AAMI,UAAQ;AANZ,CADa,EAUb;AACI,QAAM,CADV;AAEI,UAAQ,iBAFZ;AAGI,WAAS,4KAHb;AAII,WAAS,uCAJb;AAKI,aAAW,skFALf;AAMI,UAAQ;AANZ,CAVa,EAmBb;AACI,QAAM,CADV;AAEI,UAAQ,kBAFZ;AAGI,WAAS,4KAHb;AAII,WAAS,kEAJb;AAKI,aAAW,8jGALf;AAMI,UAAQ;AANZ,CAnBa,EA4Bb;AACI,QAAM,CADV;AAEI,UAAQ,kBAFZ;AAGI,WAAS,4KAHb;AAII,WAAS,8EAJb;AAKI,aAAW,kkEALf;AAMI,UAAQ;AANZ,CA5Ba,EAqCb;AACI,QAAM,CADV;AAEI,UAAQ,mBAFZ;AAGI,WAAS,4KAHb;AAII,WAAS,8DAJb;AAKI,aAAW,2hGALf;AAMI,UAAQ;AANZ,CArCa,CAAjB;AAiDA,eAAeA,QAAf","sourcesContent":["const NewsData = [\n    {\n        'id': 1,\n        'date': 'March 1, 2019',\n        'cover': \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y_Mw07i9I1qN5x-wjfoR2BXMbypo5o5Jf3SghQB68Jr6IlXukdY8BWD0nDysJmEj31AYl1YyDVAuUVKfAzZyLeuPRneS1SYcgn2X3L2JfjpJq2SoMHKXRpzCm_q20S35wn6AKtz7\",\n        'title': 'Fantuan Rush is now available',\n        'content': '<p><span>Fantuan’s latest addition, Fantuan Rush, is a game-changer for its users.

Among both locations, the New York area was the first to open. Starting September 1st, users in Flushing, Long Island, Brooklyn and other key areas of New York can order the above services through the Fantuan app, and the platform will assign the order to be delivered by a courier in the system (excluding self-pickup orders). Meals are delivered within an hour and users can rank and review their entire delivery experience on Fantuan’s platform. 10 days after its New York launch, these services became available in the Irvine, California area.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fsH8vLvhYgbBSiiHnOsZ7_xA_lUsmPPmAzwaEnGNqlhLB0685tfsSt5IulSthxd8zRzjbp65nCE8f8E33kdlR1WONk2ZQSB7Bl0_9JXHs4HX1lfYLinZ2UmO7_oz-KIUQ-dVXToC\" height=\"auto\" width=\"859\"></span></p><p><span>Fantuan’s entry into the US is the most important step for its expansion over North America. Starting in Seattle, Fantuan quickly covered the main areas and accumulated a large number of users and partner merchants. Since its launch, the order volume has increased by 150% and the number of daily active users has maintained a growth trend of nearly 200%. Fantuan now covers over 100 merchants in New York and California; the list only increasing with time. Fantuan will continue to expand to different regions in California, as well as to other areas and Chinese communities within the US.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TaN6FDlyB8gV0g04qnk9EsYmBs4RxBqSVY_8xias3Xq9x4NdN79GGizf6DICiEuW9XMtBZsC76DKaZDVtrYQX3ZwKLi77kxXm-s-MnFD-cW7_ocmIgoWKkhfWjAD02py88zu1aVI\" height=\"auto\" width=\"859\"></span></p><p><span>For merchants, the benefits of partnering with Fantuan exceed the sticky (loyal) user group. Restaurant and food pictures taken by Fantuan’s team are bright and appealing, promotion information is clear and incentivizing and app navigation is simple and easy to follow. More importantly, whereas many US food delivery platforms can only offer their users to rate their experience (ex: out of 5), Fantuan users can leave ratings and actual reviews of their experience for other consumers to reference and for merchants to improve their service quality. Although Fantuan’s services are only offered in Mandarin in most of the company’s locations, it has begun developing and offering an English version of its app in Vancouver this past October, planning to offer services in English in all its other locations in the future.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/teE3BLUWTrKgwDPwfqch7aRlgXeQHoaJqnJRSDN1Cbh98TS3xwvFCzVkIT5jw8xnckx_sKEJOZnkAqMxeSKNr7nsp7gAnXU0vUzO2oz01lRpFHeOmTK21dFHtMec9E7KodB8Infv\" height=\"auto\" width=\"859\"></span></p>',\n        'user': 'Crystal Li'\n\n    },\n    \n]\n\nexport default NewsData;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
