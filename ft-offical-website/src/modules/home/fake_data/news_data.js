        'content': '<p><span style="color: rgb(25, 31, 37); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Vancouver can be described as a true food paradise - especially in regards to authentic Asian cuisine. With such a big variety of restaurants out there, it can be difficult to decide on a place to eat from. That is why Fantuan came out with its recent feature: Fantuan Reviews.</span></p><p><span color: rgb(25, 31, 37); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Users can view the experience of others and get a better understanding of restaurants, thereby improving their restaurant search efficiency. These reviews may provide restaurants with feedback, create a restaurant yellow page and a user information sharing platform. In the future, Fantuan also plans for this feature to offer additional services, like enable customers to make group purchases and reservations, as well as obtain electronic membership cards and more.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(25, 31, 37); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Yes - other local food platforms may already offer review services, but, especially in Vancouver, these services seem to insufficiently satisfy users’ needs. While Asian cuisine accounts for a large portion of Vancouver’s food scene, in areas heavily populated with Chinese or Korean people, some of the best, most authentic restaurants do not have English names. This means that these quality restaurants cannot be found on existing local platforms efficiently, or even at all. That is where Fantuan comes in with the advantage: being able to offer honest reviews of a greater portion of Vancouver’s Asian restaurants.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(25, 31, 37); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Although Fantuan Reviews is currently only available in Vancouver, the company plans to expand this feature to all its locations in time, with the next stop being Toronto.</span></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(25, 31, 37); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FJbLm81tpnDsFECD7MifZPDzQ5_M5wIfLLGXNGpFTdABF-2r5ozB10W7LnWydCWn76G98af0KLd_E2z0s-Y3Mb7yQp-6H4Mx3y1PHV779AHxyF0fjxsX3Ucue1VFVJHnnZsG4Lfs" height="auto" width="286"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/H1ElG7Ovb2TJmgbW50otQi8ePP2z7XVe6tKbo6gnNlVTFIM3BO8AjQh-YP3d7-ZGbdbJUFgXLlPRTf_H9DULN7CvCUIEvs7GajyrK7HyUB4LqrmXEgY5QIDMuI1uG5evgHfB9ma8" height="auto" width="286"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/K9XwK72pnEQweSFTTinEglkIBt0loUj5hkoEiebbvgYOIsBeA-5GMxd9NgL29t7uoKUJ3PXYMjl6X5xcWIm7JwJQTRasgCC_0NxQDPQP8Z8BqXQF2JsCRhbgTnxwT3qnbDvj1XEv" height="auto" width="286"></span></p>',

More than 300 local young talents gathered in Vancouver to celebrate their growth and share their achievements overthe past year with the purpose of learning, making friends, mutual encouragement and development.</span></p><p style="text-align: center"><span background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/k_FyBIxmwFmTcVLInNwPmKELwbXNlQG38nOmONYP8DozIA2p5NpJAM8bjC-Q1BW3tVtAEH0OfpSlUuo_hTRxaFKAY_dCY6YfcMoDAc_2xQFav4B8dTEdoYP4esXQgJlNdCdOTcP9" height="auto" width="859"></span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Yaofei Feng, the CTO of Fantuan, was invited to accept the “YE Young Industry Leader” award, on behalf of Fantuan, and share his personal entrepreneurial experience, along with Fantuan’s development process with the guests of this event. This award reflects the Chinese community in Vancouver’s recognition of Fantuan as the leading Chinese entrepreneurial company in Vancouver. Since its establishment in 2014, Fantuan has dug deep into the technological life-services industry and is continuing to innovate and meet the needs of consumers and businesses. The company has also been actively giving back to the community for a long time, providing overseas youth with a platform for career development in the internet industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IuSNrGm57KtxJiuPtPPiM2wHpy-trUpN0W8ZKIjL_OiuwcahcuJuh_6a2MoA_jlp9Dx61xuvbpJqMIbdGFV6jw8XAaCdHqkdFfCYgMqOQyWXWCYtjyUrHykYQqfKiV_x8NUMVLBN" height="auto" width="859"></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The award was created by the Vancouver Youth League in 2017. Every year in Vancouver, about 30 representatives, people or businesses from various industries are included in the candidate list. “YE Young Industry Leader” not only requires the nominated company to have a widely recognized performance and social responsibility, but also requires the candidate to have a bold vision and unique understanding and judgment of the world’s macro-structures. Those who have been selected as “YE Young Industry Leaders” need to actively serve various industries in Vancouver, have an innovative spirit and actively contribute to help create a brighter future for the local community in Vancouver.</span></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Y1u6tVgBAgOODKNm2fGZ2qpMX_kntjAO8lAcXrG3Y5_AjjM4WffQ7ECohKZoaYJSFuGwGKRp4yU46Y1l-YnsTxIz-1Vx1PnZDkD_epqZIuwOz5yodpqT5HnO5xE3otOaJ7yAOVQS" height="auto" width="859"></span</p>',

In addition, Fantuan launched Fantuan Reviews (a review &amp; coupon service), Fantuan Rush (an errand service) and other features to equip North American users with a full range of life services.

        'content': '<p><span>On September 1, after a few months of testing the waters in Seattle, Fantuan Delivery launched its food delivery, self-pick up and errand services (Fantuan Rush) in two high-traffic areas of New York and California. Among both locations, the New York area was the first to open. Starting September 1st, users in Flushing, Long Island, Brooklyn and other key areas of New York can order the above services through the Fantuan app, and the platform will assign the order to be delivered by a courier in the system (excluding self-pickup orders). Meals are delivered within an hour and users can rank and review their entire delivery experience on Fantuan’s platform. 10 days after its New York launch, these services became available in the Irvine, California area.</span></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fsH8vLvhYgbBSiiHnOsZ7_xA_lUsmPPmAzwaEnGNqlhLB0685tfsSt5IulSthxd8zRzjbp65nCE8f8E33kdlR1WONk2ZQSB7Bl0_9JXHs4HX1lfYLinZ2UmO7_oz-KIUQ-dVXToC" height="auto" width="859"></span></p><p><span>Fantuan’s entry into the US is the most important step for its expansion over North America.

Since its launch, the order volume has increased by 150% and the number of daily active users has maintained a growth trend of nearly 200%. Fantuan now covers over 100 merchants in New York and California; the list only increasing with time. Fantuan will continue to expand to different regions in California, as well as to other areas and Chinese communities within the US.</span></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TaN6FDlyB8gV0g04qnk9EsYmBs4RxBqSVY_8xias3Xq9x4NdN79GGizf6DICiEuW9XMtBZsC76DKaZDVtrYQX3ZwKLi77kxXm-s-MnFD-cW7_ocmIgoWKkhfWjAD02py88zu1aVI" height="auto" width="859"></span></p><p><span>For merchants, the benefits of partnering with Fantuan exceed the sticky (loyal) user group. Restaurant and food pictures taken by Fantuan’s team are bright and appealing, promotion information is clear and incentivizing and app navigation is simple and easy to follow. More importantly, whereas many US food delivery platforms can only offer their users to rate their experience (ex: out of 5), Fantuan users can leave ratings and actual reviews of their experience for other consumers to reference and for merchants to improve their service quality. Although Fantuan’s services are only offered in Mandarin in most of the company’s locations, it has begun developing and offering an English version of its app in Vancouver this past October, planning to offer services in English in all its other locations in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/teE3BLUWTrKgwDPwfqch7aRlgXeQHoaJqnJRSDN1Cbh98TS3xwvFCzVkIT5jw8xnckx_sKEJOZnkAqMxeSKNr7nsp7gAnXU0vUzO2oz01lRpFHeOmTK21dFHtMec9E7KodB8Infv" height="auto" width="859"></span></p>',
